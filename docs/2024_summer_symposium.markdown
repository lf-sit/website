Tomasz M. Rutkowski received his M.Sc. in Electronics and Ph.D. in Telecommunications and Acoustics from Wroclaw University of Technology, Poland, in 1994 and 2002, respectively. He received postdoctoral training at the Multimedia Laboratory, Kyoto University.

His work as a research scientist at RIKEN Brain Science Institute from 2005-2011, demonstrates his exceptional contributions to the field he works in. From 2011-2016, Tomasz served as an assistant professor at the University of Tsukuba and a visiting scientist at RIKEN Brain Science Institute. He also served as a visiting lecturer at The University of Tokyo and was a member of an AI startup in Tokyo.

Currently, he is a research scientist at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) and a research fellow at The University of Tokyo and Nicolaus Copernicus University. Tomasz's research interests include computational neuroscience, especially brain-computer interfacing (BCI), computational modelling of evoked brain processes and awareness, and AI applications for dementia biomarkers elucidation.

His outstanding achievements include The BCI Annual Research Award 2014 for the project "Airborne Ultrasonic Tactile BCI" and a nomination for the award in 2016. He also promotes diversity in research by serving as a jury for the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Prize for Young Female Scientists in Japan.
